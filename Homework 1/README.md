# Homework
- You can find uploaded screenshots and a video (**benchmarks** dir) that demonstrate the time taken to fill the database (*Comma-Separated Values files*), and in the **data** directory you can find the company CSVs that show the correctess of the filtering and filling of the files.  
## Important Notes:
- The screenshot benchmarks are performed on my computer.
- The screen recording benchmark is done on a friend's computer. (this is done to demonstrate that different computers/networks may provide a significantly different result)
- Please note that the dates are in format *'MM/DD/YYYY'*. You can check the validity of this fact in the **parallel_filters.py** file. (this is consistent throughout the database)
