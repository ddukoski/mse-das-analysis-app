Welcome to the **Macedonian Stock Exchange (MSE) Analyst**, where numerous statistical and visualization methods are used to analyze Macedonian stock data, along with a detailed software architecture.

The project is split up into incrementive phases of development (due to the fact it's been made as a school project, with homework), with each of the following directories being a respective phase.
``Directories`` (*in chronological order of project development*):

``data_scraping`` - Starting phase for the application, where data is scraped from mse.mk site, ensuring it's consistency, and displaying arbitrary statistic related to stocks of companies over time on a graph. Benchmarks for total time of scraping is also included, on different OS platforms.

``architecture`` - Architecture definition for the project. Various design aspects are covered and documented here, as well as site UI mockups.

``ai_integration`` - Included multiple statistical analyses. Indicators were added - such as multiple moving averages and oscillators. An LSTM is trained and used for predicting future prices, and semantic transformer analysis of company news & reports (breifly) and new visualisation methods.

``containerization`` - The application is containerized (*dockerized*) in the final phase, with instructions to run the multi-container application. Design patterns, code optimization and impovement are also present.
