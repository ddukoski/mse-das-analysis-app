# Before Watching:

1. Note that the LSTM is not trained for all models, for demonstrative purposes it is trained on the first 4-5 
examples, as in the python code (**you can check the code to see that it works for all companies**).

2. Another thing, in the SRS: the LSTM, Fundamental analysis and Technical analysis are not present, because at the time,
we were not informed that we are going to implement those functions.
