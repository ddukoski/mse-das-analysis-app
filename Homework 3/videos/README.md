# Before Watching:

1. Note that the LSTM is not trained for all models, for demonstrative purposes it is trained on the first 4-5 
examples, as in the python code (**you can check the code to see that it works for all companies**).

2. Another thing, in the SRS: the LSTM, Fundamental analysis and Technical analysis are not present, because at the time,
we were not informed that we are going to implement those functions. 

3. Because of the project directory structure (Homework 1, ...) , we couldn't effectively commit or push specific parts of the code,
   so we only commited when fixing errors or when finishing an analysis/phase, and we apologize for that.
